#Queue:

A Queue is datastructure which operates with the fifo (first in forst out) principle. A Queue can store objects and you can work with them, but only in the fifo order.
  There are some typical methods: peek(), offer(), remove(); but we included also some more. We added Junit tests and a logger too.
